ESP-TEE: Trusted Execution Environment
--------------------------------------

The ESP-TEE (Espressif Trusted Execution Environment) is a security framework designed to provide hardware-enforced isolation and robust protection for sensitive operations and data on Espressif SoCs, starting with the ESP32-C6.

**Key Features:**
- **Hardware-Enforced Isolation:** ESP-TEE creates a secure environment (TEE) separate from the main application (REE), ensuring that sensitive computations and data remain protected even if the main application is compromised.
- **Secure Storage:** Sensitive data, such as cryptographic keys, are stored in encrypted flash partitions accessible only to the TEE.
- **Attestation:** Devices can generate cryptographically signed tokens to prove their identity and security status.
- **Secure OTA Updates:** ESP-TEE supports secure firmware updates for the TEE, including rollback protection and signature verification.
- **Compliance:** ESP-TEE helps products meet modern IoT security standards and certifications by providing strong isolation and secure service mechanisms.

**Architecture Overview:**
- The system is divided into two domains:

    - TEE (Trusted Execution Environment): Runs in Machine mode, handles sensitive operations, and manages secure services.
    - REE (Rich Execution Environment): Runs the user application in User mode, interacts with TEE via secure APIs.

- The TEE and REE have separate memory regions, with hardware and software mechanisms enforcing isolation.
- Secure Boot and Flash Encryption are recommended to be enabled alongside ESP-TEE for maximum protection.

**Usage:**
- Enable ESP-TEE in the ESP-IDF project configuration.
- Configure memory regions and partition tables for TEE and secure storage.
- Use provided APIs to access secure services from the REE.
- Refer to ESP-IDF documentation and examples for implementation details.
