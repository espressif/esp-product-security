Security Implementation Guide
==============================

This guide provides practical workflows and implementation guidance for building secure products using Espressif SoCs. It covers security-by-design principles, threat modeling, and step-by-step implementation processes.

Security-by-Design Workflow
----------------------------

**Phase 1: Security Requirements Analysis**

1. **Identify Security Objectives**
   
   - Define confidentiality, integrity, and availability requirements
   - Determine regulatory compliance needs (CRA, NIST, industry standards)
   - Assess data protection requirements (GDPR, privacy laws)
   - Document security policies and governance

2. **Risk Assessment & Classification**
   
   - Categorize device deployment environment (consumer, industrial, medical)
   - Identify potential threat actors and attack vectors
   - Assess business impact of security breaches
   - Define security level requirements based on risk

3. **Security Architecture Planning**
   
   - Select appropriate Espressif SoC with required security features
   - Plan hardware security module (HSM) integration if needed
   - Design secure boot and attestation architecture
   - Plan network security and communication protocols

**Phase 2: Secure Development**

4. **Hardware Security Configuration**
   
   - Enable Secure Boot (RSA/ECDSA) with appropriate key management
   - Configure Flash Encryption for code and data protection
   - Set up eFuse configuration for production devices
   - Implement debug interface protection (JTAG disable/HMAC)

5. **Software Security Implementation**
   
   - Implement secure storage using NVS encryption
   - Configure memory protection (PMS/PMP) for code isolation
   - Use hardware cryptographic accelerators (AES, SHA, RSA, ECC)
   - Implement secure OTA update mechanisms with anti-rollback

6. **Communication Security**
   
   - Implement TLS/DTLS for network communications
   - Use device certificates for authentication
   - Configure secure Wi-Fi (WPA3) or Thread networking
   - Implement secure provisioning and onboarding

**Phase 3: Security Testing & Validation**

7. **Security Testing**
   
   - Perform penetration testing and vulnerability assessment
   - Conduct side-channel attack resistance testing (if applicable)
   - Validate secure boot chain and attestation
   - Test OTA security and rollback protection

8. **Compliance Validation**
   
   - Perform compliance testing for target certifications (PSA, CLS-Ready)
   - Validate regulatory requirements (CRA, NIST guidelines)
   - Document security controls and implementation evidence
   - Conduct third-party security assessments if required

**Phase 4: Production & Lifecycle Management**

9. **Secure Manufacturing**
   
   - Implement secure device provisioning and key injection
   - Configure production-specific eFuse settings
   - Validate device identity and attestation capabilities
   - Implement supply chain security measures

10. **Security Lifecycle Management**
    
    - Establish vulnerability monitoring and response processes
    - Implement secure update delivery mechanisms
    - Monitor device security status and health
    - Plan end-of-life security considerations

Threat Modeling for Espressif Products
---------------------------------------

**STRIDE Threat Analysis Framework**

Apply STRIDE methodology to Espressif-based products (both Xtensa and RISC-V architectures):

- **Spoofing:** Device identity, certificates, network communications
- **Tampering:** Firmware modification, hardware attacks, configuration changes
- **Repudiation:** Audit logs, non-repudiation of transactions
- **Information Disclosure:** Memory dumps, side-channel attacks, network eavesdropping
- **Denial of Service:** Resource exhaustion, network flooding, device lockout
- **Elevation of Privilege:** Privilege escalation, debug interface abuse

**Common Attack Vectors**

*Physical Attacks*

- JTAG/debug interface exploitation
- Flash memory extraction and analysis
- Side-channel attacks (power, electromagnetic)
- Fault injection and glitching attacks

*Network Attacks*

- Man-in-the-middle attacks on communications
- Wi-Fi network exploitation and rogue access points
- Protocol-specific attacks (CoAP, MQTT, HTTP)
- Denial of service attacks on network services

*Software Attacks*

- Buffer overflow and memory corruption
- Firmware reverse engineering and modification
- OTA update interception and manipulation
- Configuration and credential extraction

**Threat Mitigation Strategies**

*Hardware Protection*

- Enable Secure Boot to prevent unauthorized firmware execution
- Use Flash Encryption to protect code and data confidentiality
- Implement debug interface protection (disable JTAG in production)
- Consider DPA protection for sensitive cryptographic operations

*Software Protection*

- Implement memory protection and code isolation (PMS/PMP on RISC-V, MPU on Xtensa)
- Use hardware cryptographic accelerators for secure operations
- Consider ESP-TEE framework for RISC-V based SoCs requiring advanced isolation
- Validate all inputs and implement secure coding practices
- Implement secure error handling and logging

*Communication Protection*

- Use TLS/DTLS for all network communications
- Implement certificate-based device authentication
- Use secure protocols (WPA3, Thread with security enabled)
- Implement network segmentation and access control
